Here are some of the projects you'll find in this repository:

* **Agent_1:** A simple "Hello, World!" agent and a compliment bot to get started with the basics of LangGraph.
* **Agent_2:** An agent that can handle multiple inputs and perform different operations based on the input.
* **Agent_3:** A sequential agent that processes information in a specific order, demonstrating how to create a simple workflow.
* **Agent_4:** A conditional agent that can make decisions based on the input, showcasing how to add branching logic to a LangGraph agent.
* **Agent_5:** A looping agent that can repeat a task multiple times, illustrating how to create more complex workflows.
* **AI_AGENT_1:** A simple chatbot that can answer your questions.
* **AI_AGENT_2:** A chatbot with memory, demonstrating how to create a more engaging and personalized user experience.
* **AI_AGENT_3:** A chatbot with tools, demonstrating how tools can be integrated into the graph and how LLMs can call and use these tools.
